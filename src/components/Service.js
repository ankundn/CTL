        <p>
          We have since phased out of the supply and system integration of
          security solutions to focus on investigations and advisory services.
        </p>
        <h3>Our advisory and investigation services include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Intellectual Property Violation Investigations</li>
          <li>Executive Due Diligence</li>
          <li>Pre-Investment Due Diligence</li>
          <li>Corporate Fraud and Theft Investigation</li>
          <li>Litigation Support</li>
          <li>
            Business risk mitigation ( due diligence on supply chain partners)
          </li>
          <li>
            Board advisory ( screening of directors of boards) in mergers and
            acquisitions
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Executive Due Diligence</h3>
        <p>
          From our experience, the majority of corporate crime does not
          originate from the shop floor but from the boardroom. For example a
          number of companies in Kenya and the region have lately been caught up
          in adverse publicity on account of their senior staff being involved
          in a variety of highly publicised scandals. Candidates for executive
          positions often have long job histories spanning several companies and
          geographies, so much so that a standard background check is at times
          not enough. Executive due diligence is therefore a worthwhile
          investment of resources, compared to what is at stake. We conduct due
          diligence, on behalf of clients, on executive level staff or
          candidates, as well as on key persons at prospective investee
          companies or partners. Our executive due diligence investigations may
          be tailored to cover the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Confirmation of employment history</li>
          <li>
            Confirmation of academic and professional license qualifications
          </li>
          <li>History of criminal and civil litigation</li>
          <li>Misrepresentations in their backgrounds</li>
          <li>Reputation Risks</li>
          <li>Politically exposed persons (PEPs)</li>
          <li> Client/supplier relationships</li>
          <li>Extensive reference interviews</li>
          <li>Interpol search</li>
          <li>Source of Wealth</li>
          <li>Conflict of Interest</li>
          <li>Pending Litigation</li>
          <li>Involvement in other businesses</li>
          <li>Credit Bureau Reference Checks</li>
          <li>Links to Organized Crime</li>
          <li>Verification of Credentials</li>
          <li>Debts and Solvency</li>
          <li>Judgments</li>
          <li>Regulatory Violations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any other information of interest to the client</p>
